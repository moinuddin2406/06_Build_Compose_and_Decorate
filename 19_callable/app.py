# 19. callable() and __call__()
# Assignment:
# Create a class Multiplier with an __init__() to set a factor. Define a __call__() method that multiplies an input by the factor. Test it with callable() and by calling the object like a function.

class Multiplier():
    def __init__(self, factor):
        self.factor = factor

    def __call__(self, value):
        return self.factor * value
    
if __name__ == "__main__":
        m = Multiplier(10)
        print("Callable:" ,callable(m) )
        print("Result:",m(2))
